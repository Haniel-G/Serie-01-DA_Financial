# Exploratory Analysis of the Finance Dataset

This project contains an exploratory analysis of a fictional dataset from a finance department, utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook. I developed it with the following motivations:

1. **Learning and Practical Application**: To apply and enhance my knowledge through hands-on practice.
2. **Showcasing My Coding Style**: To demonstrate how I organize and approach coding. For instance, when the dataset is not in English, I prefer to refer to its content in its native language and, when necessary, provide translations to English.

This project is primarily for demonstration purposes and does not necessarily reflect what I would do in a professional setting. (Certainly, I would take more efficient and productive approaches to analyze a dataset with more than 5 pages).

**Assumption**: This is a step in a BI analysis project.
